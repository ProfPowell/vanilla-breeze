# Changelog

All notable changes to Vanilla Breeze will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-06

### Changed (breaking)

- **Decomposed the design-system and project-planning packs out of core.** These 36 components now ship as standalone, token-driven packages and were removed from `vanilla-breeze`:
  - **Design system → [`@profpowell/vb-design-system`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@profpowell/vb-design-system):** accessibility-, breakpoint-, layout-, motion-, spacing-, token-, and type-specimen; color-palette, component-sampler, font-pairer, gradient-builder, palette-generator, semantic-palette; theme-catalog, theme-export, theme-import. (The pack also adds new components with no core equivalent: brand-specimen, icon-set, icon-specimen.)
  - **Project planning → [`@profpowell/vb-project-planning`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@profpowell/vb-project-planning):** adr-wc, burndown-chart, capacity-plan, empathy-map, gantt-chart, impact-effort, iron-triangle, kanban-board, product-roadmap, quadrant-grid, quality-target, requirement-card, review-surface, risk-register, story-map, traceability-matrix, user-journey, user-persona, user-story, work-item.
  - **Migration:** `npm i @profpowell/vb-design-system` and/or `@profpowell/vb-project-planning`. Both read VB design tokens and adopt the active theme automatically — load them on any page that also loads `vanilla-breeze`.
  - Core primitives the packs build on — `icon-wc`, `brand-mark`, `color-picker`, `drag-surface`, `chart-wc` — **remain in core.** The new terse `[data-icon]` primitive (0.2.0) also stays.

### Internal

- Relocated the DTCG serialize/deserialize/parse modules to `src/lib/dtcg/` and the public token-set catalog to `src/data/theme-catalog/` (they back the core theme/CDN build and were previously co-located with the now-removed theme components).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`[data-icon]` icon primitive** — a terse, native way to place a single monochrome icon (`<i data-icon="star">`, or on any element) via a CSS `mask` `::before` plus a tiny core-loaded enhancer, alongside `<icon-wc>`. Ships build-generated per-set no-JS stylesheets and name manifests at `/cdn/icons/<set>.css` and `/cdn/icons/<set>.json`.

### Fixed

- **Site header layout shift** — the site header now reserves its height (`header.site`), so it no longer grows and pushes the page down as chrome components upgrade on first (uncached) load.
- **List flow-spacing in flex/grid layouts** — `li` spacing no longer misfires as a cross-axis offset in flex-row or grid lists. The base `li + li` rule is now an overridable `:where()` default, and every `[data-layout]` list (which spaces with `gap`) resets it.

## [0.1.0] - 2025

Initial public release.

### Added

- **Tokens** — design tokens for spacing, typography, colors, sizing, borders, shadows, motion, and fluid scaling
- **Native element styles** — layered CSS for `<nav>`, `<table>`, `<form>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`, `<dialog>`, `<details>`, and more
- **Layout system** — `data-layout` attributes (stack, cluster, sidebar, grid) plus `data-page-layout` presets
- **30+ web components** — accordion, carousel, tabs, toast, tooltip, data-table, command-palette, combo-box, drag-surface, emoji-picker, geo-map, and more
- **Theme engine** — 10 brand themes, 18 extreme themes, 4 accessibility themes, dark/light mode
- **Accessibility** — ARIA mapping, reduced-motion support, high-contrast themes, dyslexia-friendly mode
- **Utilities** — copy-to-clipboard, hotkeys, format-number, format-date, spoiler, typewriter, and more
- **i18n** — CSS layer and JS locale utilities
- **Doc site** — Eleventy-powered documentation with interactive demos and examples
