Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes writing for the web simple and intuitive.

## Basic Formatting

### Text Styles

You can make text **bold** or *italic*, or even ***both***. Use ~~strikethrough~~ for deleted text.

### Lists

Unordered lists use dashes or asterisks:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Ordered lists use numbers:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code

Inline code uses backticks: `const greeting = "Hello";`

Code blocks use triple backticks with an optional language:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Links and Images

Create links with `[text](url)`:

[Visit the homepage](/)

Images use `![alt text](image-url)`.

## Blockquotes

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
> — Steve Jobs

## Tables

| Feature | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Headers | Yes |

## Conclusion

Markdown makes it easy to focus on content while still having rich formatting options. Start writing and see how natural it feels!
