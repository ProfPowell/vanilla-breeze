# Welcome to {{SITE_NAME}}

This is your first blog post. You can find it in `src/content/blog/first-post.md`.

## Creating Content

Add new posts by creating Markdown files in the `src/content/blog/` directory.

Each post needs frontmatter with:

- `title` - The post title
- `description` - A brief description for SEO
- `pubDate` - Publication date

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks
- Lists
- And more!

```javascript
// Code blocks are syntax highlighted
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Next Steps

1. Edit this post or delete it
2. Create your own content
3. Customize the layout and styles

Happy writing!
