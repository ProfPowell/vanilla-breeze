## Overview

Project Alpha was a comprehensive redesign of a fintech mobile application. The goal was to improve user experience, increase engagement, and make the app more accessible to a wider audience.

## Challenge

The existing app had a complex navigation structure and outdated visual design. Users reported difficulty completing basic tasks, leading to high abandonment rates.

## Solution

I conducted extensive user research and created a simplified information architecture. The new design features:

- Streamlined onboarding flow
- Intuitive navigation with clear visual hierarchy
- Improved accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Modern, clean visual design language

## Results

- 40% reduction in task completion time
- 60% increase in user satisfaction scores
- 25% increase in daily active users
