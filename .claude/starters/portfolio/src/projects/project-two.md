## Overview

Project Beta involved creating a comprehensive design system and component library for a rapidly growing SaaS platform. The system needed to scale across multiple products while maintaining consistency.

## Challenge

The company had grown quickly, resulting in inconsistent user interfaces across different products. Each team was creating their own components, leading to duplicated effort and fragmented user experiences.

## Solution

I developed a unified design system that includes:

- Core design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- 50+ reusable React components
- Comprehensive documentation and guidelines
- Figma component library with auto-layout
- Accessibility-first approach

## Results

- 50% faster design-to-development handoff
- Consistent experience across all products
- Reduced design debt significantly
- Improved team collaboration
