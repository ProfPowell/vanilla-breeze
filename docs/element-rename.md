# Element Rename

So the custom elements using x- is ok, but it is not very readable.  Many of the elements are not descriptive of use and could be improved.

x-stack -> layout-stack
x-cluster -> layout-cluster
x-grid -> layout-grid
x-sidebar -> layout-sidebar
x-card -> layout-card
x-center -> layout-center
x-cover -> layout-cover

Let's start with this and adjust the demos and docs to reflect the new names.
