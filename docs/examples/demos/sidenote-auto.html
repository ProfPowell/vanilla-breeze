    <h2>The Printing Revolution</h2>
    <p>
      Gutenberg's printing press transformed European
      society.<foot-note>Johannes Gutenberg developed movable type
      around 1440 in Mainz, Germany.</foot-note> Before its invention,
      books were copied by hand in monasteries — a single volume could
      take months to produce. The press reduced that to days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impact on literacy was
      dramatic.<foot-note>Literacy rates in Europe rose from roughly 10%
      in 1450 to over 50% by 1800, though the press was one of many
      contributing factors.</foot-note> Affordable printed material meant
      that knowledge was no longer confined to the clergy and
      aristocracy. Pamphlets, broadsheets, and eventually newspapers
      created a new public sphere for debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin Luther's 95 Theses spread across Germany within
      weeks.<foot-note>Published in 1517. An estimated 300,000 copies
      were in circulation within three years.</foot-note> Without the
      press, the Reformation might have remained a local theological
      dispute. Instead, it became a continent-wide movement that
      reshaped politics, religion, and culture for centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some content is better suited to traditional
      footnotes.<foot-note data-side="false">This note uses
      <code>data-side="false"</code> to opt out of sidenote placement
      and appear in the collected list below instead. Use this for
      longer notes that would overwhelm the margin.</foot-note>
      The <code>data-side="false"</code> attribute on individual
      <code>&lt;foot-note&gt;</code> elements forces them into the
      footnote list regardless of the container's mode.
