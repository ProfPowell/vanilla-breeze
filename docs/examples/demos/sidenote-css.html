    <h2>Darwin's Voyage</h2>
    <p>
      Darwin's voyage on the Beagle lasted nearly five years.
      <aside class="sidenote">
        1831–1836. The ship was a Cherokee-class 10-gun brig-sloop
        commanded by Captain Robert FitzRoy.
      </aside>
      During this time he collected specimens from across South America,
      the Galapagos Islands, and the Pacific. His observations of finch
      beak variation across the archipelago would later inform his theory
      of natural selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyage was not originally planned as a scientific expedition.
      <aside class="sidenote">
        FitzRoy wanted a gentleman companion to avoid the loneliness
        of command. Darwin was recommended by his botany professor
        John Stevens Henslow.
      </aside>
      FitzRoy's primary mission was to chart the coastline of South
      America and establish a chain of chronometric stations. Darwin's
      role was informal — he paid his own way and was free to explore
      at each port of call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon returning to England in 1836, Darwin began sorting his
      enormous collection of specimens and writing up his geological
      observations. It would take him another twenty years to publish
      <cite>On the Origin of Species</cite>, hesitating until Alfred
      Russel Wallace independently arrived at a similar theory.
