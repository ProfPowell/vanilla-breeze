{"id":"vanilla-breeze-fcfy","title":"Add \u003col\u003e list markup to breadcrumb navs for a11y","description":"## Context\n\nAll 44 breadcrumb `\u003cnav\u003e` elements across the site use bare `\u003ca\u003e`/`\u003cspan\u003e` without list markup. VB's CSS already supports `nav.breadcrumb \u003e ol` (provides `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; gap` plus separator styling via `li:not(:last-child)::after`). Adding `\u003col\u003e` is correct for breadcrumbs since they represent an ordered path.\n\n## Scope\n\n44 instances across two categories:\n\n### Category 1: Site doc pages (~37 instances)\nBreadcrumbs in Astro pages following this pattern:\n```html\n\u003cnav class=\"breadcrumb\" aria-label=\"Breadcrumb\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"/docs/snippets/\"\u003eSnippets\u003c/a\u003e / \u003cspan aria-current=\"page\"\u003eTabs\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/nav\u003e\n```\n\nShould become:\n```html\n\u003cnav class=\"breadcrumb\" aria-label=\"Breadcrumb\"\u003e\n  \u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/docs/snippets/\"\u003eSnippets\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cspan aria-current=\"page\"\u003eTabs\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/nav\u003e\n```\n\nThe `/` separator text should be removed — VB's `nav.breadcrumb li:not(:last-child)::after` generates separators via CSS (`content: \"/\"` by default, configurable via `data-separator`).\n\nFiles (site/pages/docs/):\n- snippets/**/*.astro (~12 files)\n- elements/**/*.astro (~5 files)  \n- examples/extensions/*.astro (~6 files)\n- integrations/*.astro (2 files)\n- lab/experiments/*.astro (~4 files)\n- lab/theme-picker/*.astro (2 files)\n\n### Category 2: Demo HTML pages (~7 instances)\nBreadcrumbs in example demo pages, mostly single back links like:\n```html\n\u003cnav aria-label=\"Breadcrumb\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"/docs/examples/\" class=\"back-link\"\u003e\u0026larr; Back to Examples\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/nav\u003e\n```\n\nThese single-link breadcrumbs could either:\n- Get `\u003col\u003e/\u003cli\u003e` wrapping for consistency\n- Or stay as-is since they're just back links (not real breadcrumb trails)\n\nFiles (docs/examples/demos/):\n- dashboard-analytics.html, grid-identity.html, layout-attributes.html, layout-attributes-refactored.html, layout-comparison.html, media-basic.html, regions-basic.html\n\n## CSS Already Supports This\n\nFrom `src/native-elements/nav/styles.css`:\n- `nav ul, nav ol { list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; }` — list reset\n- `nav.breadcrumb \u003e ol { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; gap }` — flex layout\n- `nav.breadcrumb li:not(:last-child)::after { content: \"/\" }` — auto separators\n- Separator variants: `data-separator=\"chevron|arrow|dot|pipe\"`\n\nNo CSS changes needed.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. Write a script to find all breadcrumb navs and transform them\n2. For multi-segment breadcrumbs: wrap in `\u003col\u003e/\u003cli\u003e`, remove literal `/` separators\n3. For single back-link breadcrumbs: add `\u003col\u003e/\u003cli\u003e` for consistency\n4. Verify `nav.breadcrumb` class is present on all breadcrumb navs (some may be missing it)\n5.
