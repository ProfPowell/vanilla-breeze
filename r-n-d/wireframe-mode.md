### Wireframe Mode for Design Iteration Markup First

Create a CSS layer for rapid prototyping with a sketch-like aesthetic.

- Toggle via `data-wireframe` attribute on `<html>`
- Grayscale palette with rough borders
- Hand-drawn style fonts or redacted scribble font
- Automatic lipsum possibility
- Placeholder imagery patterns grey box with x across + label of purpose for low and representative image from a placeholder site with or without color

This may need some JavaScript helpers because we may want to label things like "Hero Image" or "Primary navigation" and do so placing a small label upper left, right, or center of the element or place it in the middle depending on size available.  

I get the impression we may want to have levels of "wireframey-ness" to the approach so I think it is not quite a theme but a theme family with some JS help.  

We are eventually working towards the idea that we will have a variety of template snippets in vanilla breeze and we will provide some "site architecture" file that will be provided to a wizard or script that could scaffold up a basic working site.  I already have skills for doing this in the .claude but we are consolidating on a vanilla breeze thinking and have much work still to do.
