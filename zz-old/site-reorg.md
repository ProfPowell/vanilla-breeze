The documentation site needs reorganization and improvement.  Let's use the following structure:

home (index.html) - the home page provides overview of the project and the philosophy of the project
tokens - the design tokens the library uses.  Will have a themes section or eventually sub page and an eventual tool to build themes

elements - the index of all the elements in alphabetical order with types of elements indicated between native HTML, custom elements (no JS), and web components (require JS).  This page will eventually support a search as well as a filtering mechanism to see just elements of certain types or categories.

examples - examples of the elements in use with partials for example built out footers, headers, etc. and full page examples, one giant example kitchen sink shows all elements used on a single page.

integrations - a placeholder for now but will eventually show how to use the elements in various situations with likeminded projects like HTMX. 

IMPORTANT: We should move content around and then expand as opposed to recreate content.

Responsive fixes.  The site must be responsive and use relative units for sizing and work properly on a mobile phone context.  This site also should work in a translated context meaning that if it were automatically translated it would look good and be usable.  Addressing this with german, arabic, and Japanese would show we did it correctly.  The site will only be written in English but we will use Google Translate to translate it into other languages and test that it works properly layout wise to simulate a user visiting the site and translating it.
